# Si-and-Di-Christmas-Adventure
Python code to search for solutions to the following puzzle:

Matienzo is a world-renowned caving region in Cantabria, Spain.
Di and Si are there for Christmas and have 5 caves with different prospects they want to look at. However, after too many drinks at Bar German, they can’t remember which caves are which! 
Help them to match the cave number with the area, the prospect and the current length. No cheating by looking at the Matienzo caves website! 
¡Feliz navidad!
